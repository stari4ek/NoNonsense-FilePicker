The sample app demonstrates the SD-card file chooser in action. No configuration is necessary for that.

If you want to try the Dropbox part of the sample, you'll need to get your own
app key at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
and insert it into DropboxHelper.java and AndroidManifest.xml. See Dropbox for more details
